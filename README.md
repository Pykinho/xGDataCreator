## Description
This is a tool for aggregating shots statistics of a football game. User can choose shot position, type of shot (header, penalty, etc.), the team which took a shot and whether the shot has a goal effect. 
User receives information about coordinates, an angle and a distance to a goal from chosen shot position. Program also provides an information about probability of scoring a goal based on expected goals metric model, which is described in my other repository. There is possibility to export gathered data to a csv file.

Example:

Circles on the pitch show chosen shot positions, squares mean that the shot resulted in a goal, and the color indicates which team took a shot.
On the right side user can find information about last shot provided.
